# Aircraft Landing Prediction System

## Overview
The Aircraft Landing Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the type of landing (hard or soft) for commercial aircraft based on various factors such as flight data, pilot information, and environmental conditions. The system utilizes predictive models and data analysis techniques to improve aviation safety and decision-making processes for flight crews.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register and log in to the system securely.
- **Flight Data Management**: Provides features to input, store, and manage flight data including flight details, pilot information, and landing statistics.
- **Landing Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the type of landing (hard or soft) based on historical flight data and environmental factors.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs to display landing statistics and prediction accuracy.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Enables users to download predicted landing data for analysis and reporting purposes.
- **User Management**: Admin functionality to manage user accounts, permissions, and access control.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS
